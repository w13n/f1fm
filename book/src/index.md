# F1FM

Fantasy Formula One is a game where players select real life Formula One drivers to form a team, earn points based on how well their drivers do, and compete against other players[^note].
Each round is a separate opportunity for drivers to score points for their team, and move up or down in the season long rankings.
At the end of a season, the team with the most points total is considered the winner.

**F1FM**, or Formula One Fantasy Manager, is a desktop application to help a league manager keep up with a fantasy Formula One league.
**F1FM** can automatically download race results, calculate points scored for each team, and update team rankings, all according to season settings configured by the league manager.

[^note]: While there are other formats for Formula One fantasy, including one ran by Formula One itself, **F1FM** follows its' own custom format
